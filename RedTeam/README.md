## 🔐 VAPT RedTeam Project

A **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** project conducted for **RedTeam Hacker Academy**, where I assessed multiple web applications and successfully identified critical vulnerabilities including:

- 🐞 **SQL Injection**
- 💉 **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- 🎯 **Clickjacking**

📄 **Report**: [View VAPT Report (PDF)](https://github.com/Vishnu-S07/vapt-reports/blob/main/RedTeam/Vapt_report.pdf)

### 🎯 Objective  
To simulate real-world cyberattacks on web applications, discover security flaws, and generate a professional security report. This project improved my practical understanding of offensive security, exploitation methods, and reporting standards.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **🔧 Kali Linux** | A Linux distribution designed for penetration testing, containing hundreds of pre-installed offensive security tools. Used as the base OS for testing activities. |
| **🛡️ Burp Suite** | An integrated web vulnerability scanner used to intercept, manipulate, and scan HTTP/S requests. Crucial for testing web vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL Injection. |
| **💣 Metasploit Framework** | A powerful exploitation toolkit for developing and executing exploits. Used to simulate attacks and verify vulnerabilities. |
| **🌐 Nmap** | A network scanner for host discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration. Helped identify open ports, OS types, and running services. |
| **🕷️ OWASP ZAP** | An open-source web app scanner used to find vulnerabilities like CSRF, XSS, and insecure headers. Ideal for both automated and manual testing. |
| **📡 Wireshark** | A network protocol analyzer used to inspect captured packets in real time. Assisted in analyzing traffic, identifying credentials, and inspecting data leakage. |
